      <p>
        Hello, my name is Jake. I have always been fascinated by technology and
        with helping others. I have over 8 years of customer service experience.
        3 years are from Best Buy and 5 years are from Geek Squad. I started in the warehouse at Best
        Buy then moved to Asset Protection for 1 year 2 months, while I was
        working as Asset Protection I wanted to help customers with their
        computers. I then moved to Geek Squad as a consultation agent for 3
        years 2 months. Throughout my time at Geek Squad I developed my best
        strategies for customer service, troubleshooting and conflict resolution.
        Through my time at Geek Squad I trained 8 of my fellow agents on my strategies for best practices.
        From there I became a cadet to perform work in client's homes and help
        other agents. I then became an in home agent and performed the work
        myself to help support my team. I perform the scopes of both Home Theater
        and PC work. These tasks include mounting TVs, mounting soundbars, setting up
        modems, routers, wireless cameras, but also performing new pc setups, 
        data migrations, software installs as well as virus scans and removals.
         I have trained 2 cadets while I was an agent and in homes for over 2 years. 
         I am currently seeking Information Technology internships and other Information Technology opportunities. 
         I see my future in networking and security as a combination of the both because they work hand in hand. To
        know more about me check out
